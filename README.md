# Kenyon-Canopy

### Project purpose:

The desired purpose of this system is to allow grounds workers on Kenyonâ€™s campus to submit data based on observations of trees on campus (size, species, etc). The system will send this information to i-Tree Tools where metrics that assess how each individual tree contributes to the health of the ecosystem. These metrics will then be added to the database and representatives from the Office of Green Initiatives will be able to view either the database or a summary of the ecosystem health statistics.

### Long-term vision:

An expanded set of data entry options that would allow for landscape-level additions or subtractions. This would be particularly handy for quickly calculating the function of larger woodlots without sampling and entering every individual tree. As the database grows, finding ways to visualize the data in a dashboard setting would also be desirable for communications purposes on campus and beyond.
